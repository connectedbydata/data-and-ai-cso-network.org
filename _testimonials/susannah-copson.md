This network has been an invaluable source of both information and encouragement for grappling with the many impacts of data and digital technology on society. There is a rich diversity of expertise but also a very welcoming and positive collegial tone to the calls. They are also an opportunity to learn from and/or share insights on the most topical issues and latest civil society research. Last, but not least, there is much encouragement in finding common cause with others in what can otherwise seem an overwhelming set of issues and policy challenges.
