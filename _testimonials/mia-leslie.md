The Data and AI  Civil Society Network has been invaluable to me. As a researcher from a legal background working on data and AI policy from within a public law charity, I didn’t have instant connections to organisations or individuals with a specialism in data and technology. The Network has facilitated these connections and provided a ‘go to’ destination for me to direct questions, thoughts and ideas in a supportive and collaborative environment.
