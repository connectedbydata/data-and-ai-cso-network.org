The Civil Society Data and AI Network brings together diverse civil society organisations and campaigners to share and collaborate on policy, campaigns and advocacy on data and AI. 

Participants in the Network work for data and AI related policy and practice that is democratic and inclusive, that upholds the highest standards of human rights and brings benefits to communities, societies and the environment.

While areas of focus and tactics vary, participants recognise that data and AI policy making, narratives and practice often does not do this. We work to advocate for and amplify the voice and interests of impacted communities, groups and civil society organisations towards an equitable and socially useful approach to the design, development and deployment of AI and data driven systems.

The Network is an open access community of self-selecting organisations and individuals who have a substantial engagement on data and AI related policy, and are seeking to learn and develop this area of their work. Participants use the Network to share, coordinate and find collaborators on relevant work within and beyond the Network. 

Conversations are held in confidence and mutual respect, with the aim to encourage generosity and candidness among participants and the range of views present. 

There are no formal joining or participation requirements and new participants are welcome to join the Network.
