title: Welfare and Tech Working Group
---
The Welfare and Tech working group is a community of researchers, campaigners and policy specialists collaborating for equitable use of technologies in welfare benefits. No specific technology knowledge is necessary, with a wide range of organisations and individuals welcome to participate.

Public Law Project and Big Brother Watch co-host the meetings.

The working group meets online every 6 weeks for 30-60 mins.

If you would like to be added to the recurring calendar invite or find out anything else about the working group, please contact [Jasleen](mailto:jasleen.chaggar@bigbrotherwatch.org.uk) and/or [Caroline](mailto:c.selman@publiclawproject.org.uk).
