title: Data Bill Working Group
---
The Data Bill working group will be a forum to deep dive into the Data (Use and Access) Bill as it makes its way through Parliament, with the intention to work on legislative strategy and advocacy as each attendee sees fit.

The Ada Lovelace Institute and Open Rights Group will be co-hosting the meetings.

Meetings take place weekly online at **2 - 2:45 on Wednesdays**.

If you would like to be added to the recurring calendar invite or find out anything else about the working group, please contact [
