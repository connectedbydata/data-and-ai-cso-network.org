title: Core Network Meetings
---
The Data and AI Civil Society Network core meeting brings together trade unions, digital rights organisations, researchers, activists and charities. This meeting is the core of the Network where we can discuss current affairs in data and AI, and to seek input and collaboration for advocacy and campaigning. The core meeting also regularly hosts guest attendees from regulators, policy makers and politicians.

Connected by Data hosts the core meeting.
